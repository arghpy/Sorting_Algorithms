# Sorting Algorithms

This project was created with the goal of making practical comparisons between different sorting algorithms.

It is entirely done in C and showcases the performance of:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Radix Sort

## Compilation

```
gcc sorting_algs.c -o sorting_algs
```

## Results

The program will ask the user for:

- the size of the array
- the number of tests: how many times should the sorting algorithm be run on the randomized array data

After the algorithms perform, there will be displayed an average time of sorting for each algorithm.
